## Complexity & Information Theory

*Papers on measures of complexity, entropy, and information-theoretic tools applied to ecological time series and systems.*

- **[Permutation Entropy: A Natural Complexity Measure for Time Series](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.174102)** — Bandt C, Pompe B. *Physical Review Letters*, 88(17):174102. 2002.
  > Introduces permutation entropy (PE), a robust and computationally efficient ordinal-pattern-based measure of complexity for time series. By encoding local order relations between neighbouring values, PE captures the intrinsic irregularity of a signal without requiring assumptions about the underlying dynamics — making it especially well-suited for noisy, non-stationary ecological and environmental records.
